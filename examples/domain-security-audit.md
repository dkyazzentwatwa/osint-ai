### Step 9: Generate Comprehensive Reports

**Command:**
```
/report
```

**Output:**
```markdown
=== SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORT ===
Target: example-startup.com
Date: 2026-02-27
Classification: CONFIDENTIAL
Risk Rating: 72/100 (HIGH)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Multiple critical security vulnerabilities identified
through external reconnaissance. Immediate action 
required to prevent data breach and regulatory penalties.

CRITICAL FINDINGS (Fix within 24 hours):
🔴 GitHub repository contains exposed credentials
   Location: github.com/example-startup/legacy-api
   Files: database-credentials.json, .env
   Impact: Full database access, AWS account compromise
   
🔴 Open S3 bucket exposing customer data
   Location: s3.amazonaws.com/example-startup-backups/
   Data: 500+ customer records, financial data
   Impact: GDPR violation, $20M potential fine
   
🔴 Staging environment publicly accessible
   URL: staging.example-startup.com/dashboard
   Auth: None required
   Data: Production customer data visible
   Impact: Data breach, compliance violation
   
🔴 Database dump publicly accessible
   URL: dev.example-startup.com/db-backup-2024-01.sql
   Size: 2.1GB
   Impact: Complete data compromise

HIGH FINDINGS (Fix within 7 days):
🟡 API documentation exposed without authentication
🟡 Development environment accessible
🟡 Legacy site with 12 known vulnerabilities
🟡 Outdated WordPress installation (blog)

COMPLIANCE IMPLICATIONS:
- GDPR Article 32 violation (security measures)
- Potential fines: up to €20M or 4% annual revenue
- Required breach notification: within 72 hours
- Customer notification: may be required

REMEDIATION ROADMAP:

Phase 1 - Immediate (24 hours):
1. Rotate ALL exposed credentials
2. Secure S3 buckets (make private)
3. Remove database dump from web
4. Add authentication to staging

Phase 2 - Short term (7 days):
1. Implement API authentication
2. Secure development environment
3. Update WordPress and plugins
4. Remove or secure legacy site

Phase 3 - Long term (30 days):
1. Implement security scanning in CI/CD
2. Conduct penetration test
3. Security awareness training
4. Implement DLP solution
```

**Command:**
```
/simple-report
```

**Output:**
```markdown
=== SIMPLE SECURITY SUMMARY ===
THE BOTTOM LINE:
This startup has serious security problems that need 
immediate attention. Their customer data is exposed 
on the internet where anyone can access it.

WHAT WE FOUND (The Bad News):
🔴 Database passwords are publicly visible on GitHub
🔴 Customer data is in an open cloud storage bucket
🔴 Anyone can access their test website with real data
🔴 A full copy of their database is downloadable
🔴 API documentation is public (hackers love this)

WHAT THIS MEANS:
This is like leaving your office unlocked with customer
files sitting on the front desk. Hackers could:
• Steal all customer information
• Access the company's bank accounts
• Impersonate employees
• Shut down their systems

LEGAL PROBLEMS:
They may have violated data privacy laws (GDPR), which
could result in fines up to $20 million.

RISK LEVEL: HIGH (72/100)

WHAT THEY SHOULD DO RIGHT NOW:
1. Change ALL passwords immediately (today!)
2. Lock down the cloud storage buckets
3. Delete that database copy from the website
4. Add passwords to the test environment
5. Hire a security professional to review everything

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR INVESTORS:
High risk. Do not invest until these issues are fixed
and verified by an independent security audit.

TIMELINE TO FIX:
• Critical issues: 24 hours
• High issues: 7 days
• Full remediation: 30 days

## Investment Impact Assessment

### Risk Factors
- ⚠️ Potential $20M GDPR fine
- ⚠️ Data breach could destroy customer trust
- ⚠️ Regulatory compliance issues
- ⚠️ Technical debt in legacy systems

### Due Diligence Questions
1. When was the last security audit?
2. Do they have a CISO or security team?
3. Are they aware of the exposed S3 bucket?
4. Have they had previous breaches?
5. What cyber insurance do they carry?
6. What's their incident response plan?

### Recommendation
**DO NOT INVEST** until:
- All critical issues resolved
- Independent security audit completed
- Compliance review passed
- 30-day monitoring period completed
